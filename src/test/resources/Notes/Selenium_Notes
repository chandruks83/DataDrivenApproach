TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

	Annotations.
	Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...).
	Test that your code is multithread safe.
	Flexible test configuration.
	Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
	Support for parameters.
	Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
	TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests:  unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc...
