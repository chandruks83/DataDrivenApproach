TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

	Annotations.
	Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...).
	Test that your code is multithread safe.
	Flexible test configuration.
	Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
	Support for parameters.
	Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
	TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests:  unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc...
	
What are the Benefits of TestNG?

	It gives the ability to produce HTML Reports of execution
	Annotations made testers life easy
	Test cases can be Grouped & Prioritized more easily
	Parallel testing is possible
	Generates Logs
	Data Parameterization is possible
	
Parameterization using Data provider
	Create a method with @DataProvider annotation that returns the array data
	Use the above data in a method using @Test(dataProvider="getData") annotation
	
Using XSSFWorkbook class for accessing excel files
	fis = new FileInputStream(path);
	workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);
	sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);
	
Using reportng plugin for test reports
	Reporter.log("Log message")
	
Using Listeners to show failure screenshots
	Implement ITestListeners
	Add the class <listener class-name="com.uttara.listeners.CustomListeners"/> to the testng.xml
